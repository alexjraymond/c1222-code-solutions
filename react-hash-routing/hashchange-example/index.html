              Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
              browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
              JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
              pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
              document.

              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
              markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
              JavaScript.

            <p>
              The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule
              matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

              JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
              specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
              syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Javascript enables
              interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side
              page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
